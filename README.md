# Data Science and Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview
This project consists of seven Jupyter Notebooks, each covering a different aspect of data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning. The notebooks utilize a range of libraries and methods to explore data, make predictions, and optimize models. Below is a summary of each notebook and the techniques it covers.

## Notebooks

### 1. Scipy-Stats: Statistical Analysis
This notebook focuses on using the `scipy.stats` library for statistical analysis. It covers:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode).
- Hypothesis testing, including t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
- Distribution fitting and goodness-of-fit tests.
  
By utilizing various statistical tests, this notebook provides insights into the data’s distribution and tests hypotheses to determine statistical significance.

### 2. StatsModels: Advanced Statistical Modeling
In this notebook, we dive into statistical modeling using the `statsmodels` library. Key topics include:
- Building linear regression models to identify relationships between variables.
- Conducting time-series analysis for trend and seasonality detection.
- Implementing generalized linear models (GLM) for complex data structures.

The `statsmodels` library allows for detailed statistical tests, model summaries, and diagnostics, giving a comprehensive overview of the underlying patterns within the data.

### 3. LifeLine: Survival Analysis
This notebook uses the `lifelines` library to conduct survival analysis, commonly used in medical and customer churn datasets. Key features include:
- Kaplan-Meier estimators to estimate survival functions.
- Cox Proportional-Hazards model to analyze the effect of covariates on survival.
- Hazard function analysis to assess the risk of events over time.

Survival analysis helps in understanding time-to-event data and identifying factors that impact the duration until an event occurs.

### 4. Prophet: Time-Series Forecasting
In this notebook, we use `Prophet`, a time-series forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It covers:
- Forecasting future data points based on historical data.
- Analyzing seasonality, trends, and holiday effects.
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

*Note*: Due to the file size, this notebook may need to be uploaded separately as GitHub has file size limits.

### 5. PyMC1: Bayesian Modeling (Introduction)
This notebook introduces Bayesian statistics using the `PyMC` library. Topics include:
- Building Bayesian models to incorporate prior knowledge into predictions.
- Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods for parameter estimation.
- Simple Bayesian inference examples to illustrate how prior beliefs and observed data influence results.

Bayesian modeling allows for probabilistic predictions, accounting for uncertainty in model parameters.

### 6. PyMC2: Advanced Bayesian Modeling
Building on the previous notebook, this one dives deeper into Bayesian modeling with `PyMC`. It covers:
- Hierarchical models to handle grouped data or multi-level structures.
- Model comparison techniques to evaluate the performance of different Bayesian models.
- Posterior predictive checks to validate model assumptions.

This advanced Bayesian analysis is suitable for complex datasets where relationships among variables vary across different groups.

### 7. Optuna: Hyperparameter Optimization
This notebook explores hyperparameter tuning using `Optuna`, an optimization framework. Key topics include:
- Defining objective functions to optimize machine learning model performance.
- Using Bayesian optimization for efficient hyperparameter tuning.
- Applying Optuna with machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

Hyperparameter optimization is crucial for improving model accuracy and achieving better performance on test data.
